"DESCRIPTION": A text summarization tool condenses large amounts of text into a shorter, meaningful summary while preserving key information. Using NLP techniques, it extracts essential points from articles, documents, or conversations. Python libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and transformers help automate summarization for research, news, and business insights efficiently.
